My first project training a language model! This GPT is coded in the style of Andrej Karpathy's GPT in his series "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" lectures. It uses ideas found in the 2017 research article "[Attention is All You Need]([url](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf))", primarily the concept of self-attention as well as the general transformer architecture outlined within the paper. Happy generating!
